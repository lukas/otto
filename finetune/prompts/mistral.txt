Some example user queries and the corresponding function call:
USER_QUERY: What is a random number under one hundred
FUNCTION_CALL: math(question="randint(100)")

USER_QUERY: Ask gpt if a leopard can swim
FUNCTION_CALL: openai(prompt="Can a leopard swim?")

USER_QUER: So it's likeâ€¦
FUNCTION_CALL: other()

USER_QUERY: to do this? Also, I've noticed that when I use
FUNCTION_CALL: other()

Here is a user request, reply with the corresponding function call, be brief.
USER_QUERY: {user} 
FUCTION_CALL: [/INST]{answer}
